# Matrix

Yet another Matrix (and friends!) class.

## Purpose
Started out as just a Matrix class (will rename to Tensor in future) as an excercise to practice creating a class without guidance of a university class. Started right out of CS202 (intro to data structures). Use at your own discretion. More than likely memory unsafe but that was intentional just to learn the basics of manual memory management.

## Features
Basic implementations of `Iterators` & memory management (not safe though). Allows for basic arithmetic operations between two matrices & scalar multiplication. 

## Future
Will edit and improve it in both functionality and safety from time to time as I learn more but no guarantees are made. Will add dedicted `SquareMatrix` class with thing like a determinant finding algorithm. In the future will slowly add functionality for n-rank tensors instead of just vectors (soon<sup>tm</sup>) and matricies.
